The Conversion application gives the user ability to convert between different units of length, temperature and weight. The Converter utilizes ScrollView layout, therefore enables application scrolling in both portrait and landscape modes. The application implements one Activity where user makes all of his selections and views conversion result. The layout uses multiple TextViews, Spinners, EditText box and Buttons with both RelativeLayouts and LinearLayouts. The user first selects conversion category which causes appropriate arrays being loaded into "From" and "To" spinners. Then user enters quantity to convert and selects "From" scale and "To" scale. 'Convert' button triggers appropriate calculation being performed and result displayed - resulting converted quantity is displayed with maximum of 4 decimal places. 'Clear' button clears EditText and TextView elements. Application also makes use of a Toast with a message when invalid input is encountered. Finally, the user can exit the application using 'Exit' option from menu.
